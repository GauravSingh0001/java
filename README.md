# Java Programming with DSA & Patterns

This repository contains a collection of various Java programs focused on different Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts, along with pattern generation programs. These programs cover a wide range of topics from basic Java syntax to advanced concepts like sorting, recursion, and more.

## Projects Included

- **Java Patterns**: Various Java programs that generate different types of patterns, such as square, triangle, butterfly, and rhombus patterns.
- **Data Structures and Algorithms**: Java implementations of common algorithms like sorting, searching, recursion, etc.
- **Mathematical Functions**: Programs for calculating averages, sums, checking even/odd numbers, and more.

### Sample Programs:
- **Area of Square**
- **Area of Circle**
- **Floyd's Triangle**
- **Butterfly Pattern**
- **Palindrome Checker**
- **Leap Year Checker**
- **Sum of Last Digit**
- **Type Casting & Promotion**
- **Even/Odd Number Check**

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: All programs are written in Java and are intended to help you learn basic to advanced Java programming and data structures.
